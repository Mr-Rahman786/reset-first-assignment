                <p>It is possible to donate in the name of a third party, making a gift in honor or in memory of someone or something.
                Gifts in honor or memory of a third party are made for various reasons, such as holiday gifts, wedding gifts, in memory
                of somebody who has died, in memory of pets or in the name of groups or associations no longer existing. Memorial gifts
                are sometimes requested by their survivors </p><br><br><br>
